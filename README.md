## The Cloned Pokédex

**A Pokédex reborn.** This project recreates the classic Pokédex experience with a modern twist. Just like Mewtwo, it's built from the genetic material of something powerful (the PokéAPI!), but with its own unique abilities.

**Features:**

* **Fetch and Display:**  Dynamically fetches Pokémon data from the PokéAPI using structured queries.
* **Card Organization:**  Presents Pokémon information in clean, organized cards.
* **DOM Manipulation:**  Utilizes JavaScript's DOM manipulation to bring the Pokédex to life.
* **Pure CSS Styling:**  Styled with pure CSS for a sleek and responsive design.

**Dive into the world of Pokémon like never before!** Explore detailed information, discover new favorites, and maybe even catch 'em all (virtually, of course).

**This project was created as a learning exercise to explore:**

* Asynchronous JavaScript (fetching data)
* API interaction and JSON handling
* DOM manipulation techniques
* CSS styling and layout

**Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute!**  Let's evolve this Pokédex together.
